# VRPet
Creating a virtual pet with Unreal Engine 4
In this project I have created a fully animated fox that will play fetch with a ball, sit on command and bite when prompted.
Building up to this I had experimented with other forms of artifical intelligence and interaction in UE4 with npc's and pc's. 

This code uses the assests from the AnimalVarietyPack. The full project exceeds the limit of what can be placed on Github.
